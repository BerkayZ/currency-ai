## Intro
This project is a research endeavor, and it is important to note that the outcomes may not be guaranteed at 100%. It is strongly advised **not to execute trades **solely based on the results derived from this project.

### Results

The AI, trained on minute-by-minute Bitcoin price data spanning from 2017 to 2022 (Dataset:[ BTC/USD Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/btcinusd/ " BTC/USD Kaggle Dataset")), produced the following price predictions for March 2022:

    [43329.863]
     [43320.164]
     [43336.984]
     [43315.46 ]
     [43318.227]
     [43335.13 ]
     [43348.35 ]
     [43344.535]
    ...
     [42962.08 ]
     [43015.586]
     [43049.965]
     [43067.418]
While the initial results appear promising, it is crucial to acknowledge that ongoing tests and updates will be necessary to further evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of the model.
